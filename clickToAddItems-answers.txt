1,What happens when you leave num1 or num2 empty?

ans: Alert message pops out saying:"Num1 must be filled in with a number" , if
num1 text box is left empty. and so as is the num 2 text box.

2,For browsers that do not support the input type of "number," what happens when you enter in alphanumeric (letters and numbers) values?

ans: alphabes  do work in both num1 and num2 text boxes.

3,What happens if you enter "0" for num2? How does JavaScript handle the divide-by-zero situation?

ans:In this function, we will use the clearErrors() function so that we can reset our errors state to a cleared state. We will then use value to get the entered value from the <input> boxes. If those values are either empty ("") or not a number (isNaN()), then we will:

Display an alert() message stating that the respective input box needs to be a number.
Add the Bootstrap has-error class to the form-group.
Set the focus() to the input box in error.
Return "false" to prevent form submission.


num1 empty---result alert to enter number in num1
num1 0------- result:nan
num1 any number----result is infinity


num2 is 0 in all the cases then in division case the above is observed
